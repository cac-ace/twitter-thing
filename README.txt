Done on an RPi 3
This code will take a photo with the path "/home/pi/Pictures/one.jpg" and post it with the caption "A cat photo!" to a correctly configured Twitter account.
This is not automatic and is done with a command in console.
The access tokens have been replaced with placeholder phrases.

Credits to Scott Kildall for his guide to setting up an RPi Twitter bot, which shows how to get the access tokens.
